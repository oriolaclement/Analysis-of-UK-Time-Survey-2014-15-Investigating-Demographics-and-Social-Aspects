# Analysis-of-UK-Time-Survey-2014-15-Investigating-Demographics-and-Social-Aspects

Amy Jones is interested in investigating the demographic and social aspects of individuals in the UK. Since Amy does not have much formal statistical background, she is seeking your help on some questions she is interested in. You advise her to use data from the "UK time survey 2014-15". A subset of the UK time survey 2014-15 is presented in the accompanying Excel file ('UK time survey').
By analyzing the survey data, you are required to prepare a report for Amy that answers the questions below. A description of data variables is given at the end of the questions.
Your report should include the academic report writing components (introduction, discussion, analysis, conclusion, etc)
The following questions are required to be answered. All calculations must be carried out using the accompanying data ('UK time survey') in Excel.

- own a vehicle,
- are divorced,
